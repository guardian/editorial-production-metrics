## Forking
A piece of content has been when (if it started in composer) it is sent to incopy. Or if it started in incopy it has been sent to composer. Once a piece of content has been forked there are 2 copies of the same article. Editing one does not affect the other.

## Fork Time
This is a metric recorded every time a piece of content is forked. It is a script that runs on managed macs. If changes need to be made to this script talk to ESD. Fork Time is the number of milliseconds between the content being forked and the time the last edition goes to print (typically 5am).
